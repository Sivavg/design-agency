## 📁 Project Structure
The code is structured modularly for maintainability and scalability. All sections are isolated into their own components.

├── app/
│   ├── layout.jsx         # Root layout with Navbar, Footer, and SEO metadata
│   ├── page.jsx           # Main homepage stitching all sections together

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js (version 18 or above) installed on your system.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in the terminal to install all necessary packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server
Start the local development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open in Browser
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. 

## 💡 Assumptions & Design Decisions
- **Dark Theme Priority:** Opted for a sleek, modern dark theme (Slate-950) with blue/purple accents, as this is currently a popular trend among high-end design agencies, creating an immediate "wow" factor.
- **Component Separation:** Chose to separate each section into its own Client Component (`"use client"`) because they utilize interactive elements (like `framer-motion` hooks, `useState` for forms, and `useEffect` for the navbar scroll).
- **Contact Form Simulation:** The contact form simulates an API request with a `setTimeout` to demonstrate loading states and success feedback, showing attention to UX details.
